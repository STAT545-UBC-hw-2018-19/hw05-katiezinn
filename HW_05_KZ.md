Welcome to my 5th homework assignment. This assignment has 4 parts and is about factor and figure management.

Part 1: Factor management
=========================

For this part I will drop factors/levels and reorder levels based on knowledge from data.

My plan is to: 1) Drop Asia from the Gapminder data and show proof. 2) Reorder the levels of continent

First, I will load all the packages that this assignment requires

``` r
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(gapminder))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(knitr))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(kableExtra))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(cowplot))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(plotly))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(scales))
```

Part 2: File I/O
================

For this part I will experiment with changing, reading, and writing files

My plan is to: 1) *** 2) ***

Part 3: Visualizing design
==========================

For this part I will create a figure with what I leanrnt in recent classes in mind. I will use a figure from my first homework assignment (yikes) and recreate it.

My plan is to: 1) Show, and recreate a figure from my first homework assignment with an explanation of why it is better. 2) Recreate this figure using plotly, and expalin the benefits of using plotly.

Part 4: Writing figures to file
===============================

For this part I will use *ggsave()* to save a plot to a file. then I will use ! \[Alt text\] (/path/to/img.png) \* to load and embed it in my report.

But I want to do more!
======================

Wait... do I?? Let's see how long this takes first.
